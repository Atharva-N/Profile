    <p>Summary
        I dream to Fly High in the Air, Explore the contours of the Globe
        through the eyes of a Pilot. Pursuing my Professional Engineering
        Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from DJ Sanghvi
        College of Engineering, University Of Mumbai. With Strong academic
        records and ever-growing passion for Computer Applications, I am
        dedicating my efforts to harness the power of Technology to drive
        innovation.
        Skilled in HTML, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python, I've also
        delved into the world of Android app development. I've honed these
        skills through Google-backed courses in Python and Android app
        development, demonstrating my commitment to staying at the
        forefront of Tech trends.
        Currently, I'm furthering my expertise through a comprehensive
        Machine Learning course offered by Amazon Web Services,
        ensuring I'm well-equipped to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.
        My passion for technology extends beyond the classroom. I have
        hands-on experience of 3 months interning at Intrainz, where I
        contributed to developing an application for tracking Covid patients
        nearby.
        I'm excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, mentors, and
        industry professionals to collaborate and share insights. Let's explore
        how we can make a positive impact together!</p>
